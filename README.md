# Square-Root-Sorting-Algorithm

Each algorithm has its own advantages and disadvantages according to 
environment and this algorithm has some disadvantages that will become known 
in the future after being implemented in different environments, which requires 
time.
In this thesis, we have introduced a new algorithm called Square Root Sorting 
Algorithm which uses a new method for sorting data items in the memory, and 
compared the time complexity of this algorithm with some of the algorithms 
available in the sorting section. The time complexity of this algorithm in best case 
is equal to O(𝑛 log√𝑛) and in the cases of the worst case and the average case
is equal to O((𝑛 log√𝑛) + 𝑐𝑛).
Which is much better than the previous algorithms like merge, insertion, and 
selection etc., this algorithm is like a method that one of its parameters could be 
one of the best available algorithms, which is a feature of the SR algorithm that 
reduces its time complexity that we have explained in our result and discussion.
